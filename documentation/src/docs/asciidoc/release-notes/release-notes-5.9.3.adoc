=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* Parameter types for _local_ `@MethodSource` factory method names are now validated. For
  example, `@MethodSource("myFactory(example.NonexistentType)")` will now result in an
  exception stating that `example.NonexistentType` cannot be resolved to a valid type.
* The syntax for parameter types in _local_ `@MethodSource` factory method names now
  supports canonical array names -- for example, you may now specify `int[]` as in
  `@MethodSource("myFactory(int[])"` instead of the _binary_ name `[I` as in
  `@MethodSource("myFactory([I)"` (which was already supported) and
  `@MethodSource("myFactory(java.lang.String[])` instead of
  `@MethodSource("myFactory([Ljava.lang.String;)`.
* The search algorithm used to find `@MethodSource` factory methods now applies consistent
  semantics for _local_ qualified method names and fully-qualified method names for
  overloaded factory methods.
* Exceptions thrown for files that cannot be deleted when cleaning up a temporary
  directory created via `@TempDir` now include the root cause.
* Lifecycle methods are allowed to be declared as `private` again for backwards
  compatibility; however, using `private` visibility for lifecycle methods is strongly
  discouraged and will be disallowed in a future release.

==== New Features and Improvements

* The search algorithm used to find `@MethodSource` factory methods now falls back to
  lenient search semantics when a factory method cannot be found by qualified name
  (without a parameter list) and also provides better diagnostics when a unique factory
  method cannot be found.
