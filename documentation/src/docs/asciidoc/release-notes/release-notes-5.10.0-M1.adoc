[[release-notes-5.10.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Building native images with GraalVM now requires configuring the build arg
  `--initialize-at-build-time=org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherConfig`.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Promote various "experimental" APIs that have matured to "stable" including
  `ModuleSelector`, `EngineDiscoveryListener`, `EngineDiscoveryRequestResolver`,
  `LauncherSession`, `LauncherSessionListener`, parallel execution support classes,
  `@Suite` and related annotations, and others.
* All utility methods in `ReflectionSupport` that return a `List` now have counterparts
  which return a `Stream`.
* For consistency with JUnit Jupiter lifecycle callbacks, listener method pairs for
  started/finished and opened/closed events are now invoked using "wrapping" semantics.
  This means that finished/closed event methods are invoked in reverse order compared to
  the corresponding started/opened event methods when multiple listeners are registered.
  This affects the following listener interfaces:
  `TestExecutionListener`, `EngineExecutionListener`, `LauncherDiscoveryListener`, and
  `LauncherSessionListener`.
* New `LauncherInterceptor` SPI for intercepting the creation of instances of `Launcher`
  and `LauncherSessionlistener` as well as invocations of the `discover` and `execute`
  methods of the former. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-launcher-interceptors-custom, User Guide>> for
  details.
* Support for limiting the `max-pool-size-factor` for parallel execution via a
  configuration parameter.
* New `testfeed` details mode for `ConsoleLauncher` that prints test execution events as
  they occur in a concise format.
* The existing functionality of the `ConsoleLauncher` has been split into two subcommands:
  `execute` for executing tests and `engines` for listing registered test engines.
* A new `discover` subcommand has been added to the `ConsoleLauncher` to print the
  discovered tests for the specified details mode without executing them.


[[release-notes-5.10.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `dynamic` parallel execution strategy now allows the thread pool to be saturated by
  default.
* Implicit type conversion of boolean values like in `@CsvSource` is now stricter, only
  allowing values `"true"` or `"false"` (case-insensitive), in order to make accidental
  mistakes apparent, avoiding potential confusion.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Promote various "experimental" APIs that have matured to "stable" including
  `MethodOrderer`, `ClassOrderer`, `InvocationInterceptor`,
  `LifecycleMethodExecutionExceptionHandler`, `@TempDir`, parallel execution annotations,
  and others.
* `@RepeatedTest` can now be configured with a failure threshold which signifies the
  number of failures after which remaining repetitions will be automatically skipped. See
  the <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-repeated-tests, User Guide>> for details.
* New `ArgumentsAccessor.getInvocationIndex()` method that supplies the index of a
  `@ParameterizedTest` invocation.
* `@EmptySource` now supports additional types, including `Collection` and `Map` subtypes
  with a public no-arg constructor.
* `DisplayNameGenerator` methods are now allowed to return `null`, in order to signal to
  fall back to the default display name generator.
* New `AnnotationBasedArgumentsProvider` convenience base class which implements both
  `ArgumentsProvider` and `AnnotationConsumer`.
* New `AnnotationBasedArgumentConverter` convenience base class which implements both
  `ArgumentConverter` and `AnnotationConsumer`.
* New `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.max-pool-size-factor` configuration
  parameter to set the maximum pool size factor.
* New `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.saturate` configuration
  parameter to disable pool saturation.
* New `TempDirFactory` SPI for customizing how the `TempDirectory` extension creates
  temporary directories. See the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory, User Guide>>
  for details.
* If a non-static `@MethodSource` factory method is used with test instance per-method
  lifecycle semantics, the exception thrown now informs the user that the factory method
  must be `static` unless the test class is annotated with
  `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`.
* Introduced kotlin contracts for kotlin assertion methods
